    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    Solving for runtime effeciency was key for this course. While the data involved was small, an improperly implement algorithm has a small impact. But over millions of lines, there could be a huge waste of resourses by using a less effecient design.
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    I approached the problem by reviewing the pseudocode for each of the structures. By writing the pseudocode I was able to see where there were ineffeciencies that needed to be addressed.
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    If I had any roadblocks, I would usually take a 15 minutes break and then come back to my issue. If I still could not get it working, then I add a FIXME with my notes and move on, coming back to that issue later with a clear head.
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    This course laid bare what a lot of languages has abstracted away, the making of the <map> for example. By seeing how it is created, as well as the limitations I have a much better understanding of each strucute, as well as several common algorithms.
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I have begun changing the way I write programs to add in more pseudocode as a first pass, and then going back to my methods and coding it. I think that as I am still learning specific syntax in langugages, it reduces errors by making me slow down.
